# ![4Geeks Logo](http://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=4geeks,16) Traffic Light with React

✏ *Simulating a traffic light similar to ***./preview.gif****.

## Goals 👽 
- The light has to ***glow when clicked***.
- The whole purpose of the component is ***displaying a traffic light*** with red, yellow and green lights.
- When any light is clicked, it has to glow, but the other lights have to stop glowing.
- The component has a hooked state variable that tracks the color.
- The ***Get Random*** button cycles the traffic light color between red, green and yellow.
- The ***Purple!*** button ads an extra color *purple* to the traffic light.

## Preview 🎬
